## Instructions :clipboard: 

The first step is to clone the repository and install the project dependencies.
###To run the backend in local host:
Copy .env.example file on root directory and just change the name to .env:
 `php composer install`
 `php artisan migrate`
 `php artisan passport:install`

Run the server
`php artisan serve`

###To run the backend from Heroku Deploy:
Copy .env.example file on root directory and configure the data to interact with Heroku:

 `php composer install`
 `php artisan migrate`
 `php artisan passport:install`



<br>

On the other side, you will need to clone the backend from https://github.com/ApcarJo/BackEnd_ReactMovieSuite and follow its instructions to run it.

Register as a client to use the web app.
Use: admin@gmail.com * 123456 to access admin role.

This app uses themoviedatabase api to get the data needed for the webapp https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=es-ES

Thanks to all our classmates for the help and work as a great team.

Things runned out of time to implement:
- Better design of the content scroll
- Gradient on scroll
- Price and costs calculation of the rents
- Error when register allow you to create an account without a match with repeat password
- Responsive design
- Movies by actor, I have failed the endpoint, only actor info with some "known for" movies, so I removed of the search option.
- To be able to hide the "movie card rent" when you see homescreen first time
- Heroku deployment

Things I am proud of
- The modify system
- The show and hide of the datePicker when you are going to rent a movie
- The functionality of the movies content carrousel where you can navigate all the pages the moviedatabase api can offer
